# loadit
Load and save your configuration like a BOSS !!!

Have you ever experienced parsing code for your configuration being verbose? LoadIt neatly organizes your configuration in one python object and can be saved or imported from json file. Also if you ever need cli argument parsing feature, you are good to go with one line of code. Folks are always welcome to contribute.
